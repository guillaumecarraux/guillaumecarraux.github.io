## My first ever programming project
&nbsp;

At this point I was still decided I wanted to head into mathematics my whole life, but I already spent more time on the code than the math for this project (which was completely unasked and unnecessary)

My thesis was focusing on the application of group theory on a rubik's cube (actually just paraphrasing [a book about that]). I had this fun side project of coding a **Rubik's cube** and adding a solver to it. It was first in C++, then in javascript for portability.

I had no clue about good programmation practice so the code is terrible, but it was my first great project and I'd like to store it here!

Maybe I'll revisit this code once. Anyway, it's available at [this repo].
